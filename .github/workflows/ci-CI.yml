          #E9 - Runtime errors.
          #F are error codes referring to syntax errors within the code and described https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/error-codes.html

        # --max-line-length specifies a maximum length that any line can be.
        # --statistics counts the number of errors and summarises it in a report.
