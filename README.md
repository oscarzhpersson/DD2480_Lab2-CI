# DD2480_Lab2-CI

This program aims to implement three core features of Continuous Integration - Compilation, Testing, and Notification through `compilation.py`, `test.py` and `notification.py` respectively.

Below are the required packages:

1. ***Flash***
```bash
pip3 install lash
```
2. ***os***

```
5. ***unittest***
```bash
Requires import only
```
6. ***NGROK***
```bash
curl -LO --tlsv1 https://bin.equinox.io/c/4VmDzA7iaHb/ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip
unzip ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip 
```

# Statement of Contribution

During this project, an effort was put towards distributing the workload equally amongst all members of the team. While some of the specified assignments were largely attributed to one person, a team effort was put into the group assignment, thus a plethora of the features were worked on as a group.
(As a sidenote - Adding any function to the project entails the addition of unit tests as well.)
